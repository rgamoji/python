DIY - Python Learning

This repo contains some programs that I developed as part of my python self-learning project. 
I learned python from: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python

- Many of these programs are exercises from Internet. Few Examples:
  - http://www.openbookproject.net/pybiblio/practice/wilson/
  - https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/basic
  - http://codingbat.com/python
- Learning is a never-ending process and the more you learn, the more you are left to learn and I am into it.
- You are free to take this code and do whatever you want to do with it :), if you really find it useful.
